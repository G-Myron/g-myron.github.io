## CHESS:

1. piece.square: Try to remove all the comments.

- 2. pwan promotion: After save and restore from session it becomes pawn again.

3. initializePieces(): work with null values and eaten pieces, work with initial value if session is empty.

4. gameEnd(): Optimize it & Check when it is called (if the saved session is a finished game will it be called?)
5. gameEnded: Think about it..
6. isnotThreatened: Throws error when game ends.

7. Global variables etc. eg. findMovesPiece
8. isThreatened? When should it be called? If opponent plays?

9. Optimize structure so state can be easily saved! !!!
10. Save piece.moved

11. Castle: save in memory (see photo)

12. Frontend
