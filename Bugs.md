## CHESS:

### Remember in any change of the code to update the chess-README.md fie (in draft folder).

1. All TODOs in comments
2. Frontend design (e.g. Organize the placing of eaten pieces)

3. initializePieces(): work with null values and eaten pieces, work with initial value if session is empty.
4. checkKings()

5. Global variables etc. eg. findMovesPiece
6. isThreatened? When should it be called? If opponent plays?

7. Optimize structure so state can be easily saved!!!
8. Save piece.moved - Or better not use it at all, find a better way

9. Castling: save in memory (see photo)
- 10. Check putPieceOnSquare if(!square) for the case piece is moved by the user outside of the board:
    If you move a king out of board game ends.

11. Possible problems: Changed `let` to `const` in many places..
